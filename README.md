## How to Install Google Chrome Portable Offline

If you're unable to install Google Chrome Portable using the online installer due to internet issues or system restrictions, you can **manually download the necessary files** and install it **offline** using the steps below.

### Prerequisites

* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or another archive tool
* The `.paf.exe` online installer
* A web browser to manually download files

ㅤ
### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Download the Online Installer

Download the PortableApps `.paf.exe` **online** installer from [PortableApps (SourceForge) page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/portableapps/files/Google%20Chrome%20Portable/).

For example: `GoogleChromePortable_3.0.195.27_online.paf.exe`

#### 2. Extract the Installer Config File

* Open the `.paf.exe` file using **7-Zip**
* Navigate to: `App\AppInfo\`
* Extract the file called `installer.ini`

#### 3. Find the Direct Download URL

* Open `installer.ini` with a text editor
* Look for the line:

  ```
  DownloadURL=https://...
  ```
* This is the **direct download link** for the actual application content

#### 4. Download the Actual App File

* Use your browser to download the file from the `DownloadURL`
* Save it in the **same folder** as the `.paf.exe` installer

#### 5. Run the Installer Offline

* Now run the `.paf.exe` installer
* It will detect the file you downloaded and **use it directly** without needing to connect to the internet
